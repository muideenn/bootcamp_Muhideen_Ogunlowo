# Stage 15 — Orchestration & System Design

This folder contains:
- `orchestration_plan.md`: your concise orchestration plan (DAG + tasks + logging/checkpoints).
- `refactor_demo/`: one task refactored into a reusable Python function with a CLI wrapper and logging.
- `notebooks/`: starter notebook for this stage.
- `docs/`: the homework sheet PDF.
- `data/`: placeholders for raw and processed files.
- `logs/`: where the refactor demo writes run logs.

Project theme: **Cross‑Asset Correlation Analysis** (equities ↔ bonds), integrated with your Bootcamp repo structure.
