# Stage 16 — Lifecycle Review

This folder contains the completed assets for **Lifecycle Review & Reflection**.

## Contents
- `stage16_lifecycle-review_homework-starter.ipynb` – filled-in starter notebook with reflections, repo polish checklist, and export cell.
- `stage16_framework_guide_completed.md` – completed Framework Guide mapping stages 1–16 to the project.
- `stage16_lifecycle-review_framework_guide_table.md` – original guide template (for reference).
- `stage16_lifecycle-review_homework-sheet.pdf` – assignment sheet (for reference).
- `stakeholder_summary.md` – short, non-technical summary.

## How to Use
1. Open the notebook and run all cells (top to bottom).
2. The notebook validates your repository structure and exports a consolidated `lifecycle_report.md`.
3. Commit and push this folder to your repo under `stage16_lifecycle-review/`.

## Repo Polish Checklist (Quick)
- Clean structure: `data/`, `src/`, `notebooks/`, `docs/`, `README.md`
- `requirements.txt` updated and minimal
- Clear `README` with project scope, how to run, and lifecycle mapping
- Notebook outputs cleared (keep small, reproducible artifacts only)
- Add `stakeholder_summary.md` for non-technical readers
- Tag final release (e.g., `v1.0-stage16`), write release notes
