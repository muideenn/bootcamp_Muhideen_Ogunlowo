# Deliverables â€” Audience & Format

**Audience chosen:** Busy senior stakeholders (VP / Director level) who need clear, decision-oriented takeaways without deep technical detail.

**Rationale:** A concise Markdown report (also pasteable to a wiki) balances clarity and portability. It embeds headlines, visuals, and a one-page sensitivity summary. This format is fast to iterate on and easy to share as a PDF if needed.

**Files**
- `final_report.md`: the stakeholder-facing report
- `images/`: exported figures (PNG)
- `sensitivity_table.csv`: scenario deltas vs baseline
